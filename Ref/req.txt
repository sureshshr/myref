Build a Java web application with the following features:

Dynamically schedule jobs using cron expressions (e.g., 0/30 * * * * ?)

List all currently scheduled jobs (name, group, next fire time)

Delete specific jobs by name and group

Use Quartz Scheduler with JDBCJobStore for persistence:

Jobs should survive server/application restarts

Use MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server for job storage

Use JAX-RS (Jersey) for exposing REST APIs:

POST /api/jobs â†’ to schedule a job

GET /api/jobs/list â†’ to list all jobs

DELETE /api/jobs/{group}/{name} â†’ to delete a job

Include a simple frontend (HTML + JS) to:

Schedule a job

View all jobs

Delete a job

Include:

quartz.properties file configured for JDBCJobStore

SQL schema for Quartz tables (e.g., tables_mysql_innodb.sql)

Maven pom.xml with required dependencies

ServletContextListener (optional) to manage lifecycle

Optionally allow clustering support (isClustered=true)

Provide example Java classes:

ScheduledJob.java, JobScheduler.java, JobResource.java

- **Data Integration** â†’ Scheduled ETL pipelines and API synchronization
- **Monitoring Overhead** â†’ Built-in analytics and performance tracking

### For Developers

- **Complex Scheduling Logic** â†’ Simple cron expressions with visual builder
- **Custom Job Requirements** â†’ Extensible job framework with templates
- **Integration Needs** â†’ Full REST API for system integration

## ðŸŒŸ Key Differentiators

1. **Zero-Code Job Creation**: Pre-built templates for common tasks
2. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live dashboard with execution analytics
3. **Enterprise Reliability**: Database persistence with clustering support
4. **Modern UX**: Responsive design with dark/light themes
5. **Developer Friendly**: Clean APIs and extensible architecture

## ðŸ“Š Use Case Examples

### Financial Operations

- Daily sales reports at 6 AM

- Customer analytics weekly

### System Maintenance

- Log cleanup every Sunday
- Cache optimization hourly
- Health checks every 5 minutes

### Marketing Automation

- Newsletter campaigns weekly
- Birthday emails daily
- Social media posts scheduled

## ðŸš€ Getting Started (30 seconds)

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd schedulerapp
./run-app.sh
# Open http://localhost:8081
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Value
